    biography:
      " L.M. Douglas is an up-and-coming author based in Edinburgh. Her passion for writing began in childhood, when she devoured the works of beloved fantasy authors such as C.S. Lewis, Enid Blyton, and Lewis Carroll. She found the time and inspiration to bring her own fantastical world to life during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Balancing her time between managing a busy pub with her husband, taking care of her teenage son, and crafting her intricate tales, she poured her heart and soul into her writing, and Chronicles of the Endless war was born. \n\n‘Gharantia's Guardian’, the first book in the series, is set to release in Autumn 2023, and promises to captivate readers with its unique blend of mystery, magic, and adventure.",
